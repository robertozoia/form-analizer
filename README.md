# form-analizer
A tool that extract form data (input fields, etc.) from a website.  Helpful for writing login code.

For now, results are printed on the terminal.

As the saying goes, 'If you are going to do something more than once, write a script to do it for you.'  I use this script to extract the data needed to write code to login into websites.

## Usage

	$ python form_analizer.py --url https://example.com


## Requirements

	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
